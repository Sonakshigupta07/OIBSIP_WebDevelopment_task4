# OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_task4

PROJECT : Login Page

Objective :
This is a simple, clean, and responsive Login Page built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's part of my internship task for **Oasis Infobyte** (Web Development – Task 4). Whether you're signing up or logging in, the UI is designed to be smooth and easy to use.

🚀 What It Does : 
- ✨ Clean, modern login and signup forms  
- 🔁 Toggle between Sign In and Sign Up views  
- 🎨 Styled using CSS with subtle animations  
- 📱 Fully responsive – works great on all screen sizes  
- 🔐 Optionally supports password validation logic  

🛠️ Built With
1. HTML5 – page structure
2. CSS3 – styling and layout  
3. JavaScript – form toggle & interactions  
4. Font Awesome – for the icons (user, email, lock, etc.)

1. How to structure a form-based page using HTML.
2. Styling responsive designs with modern CSS.
3. Adding dynamic UI interactions using JavaScript.
4. Managing form behavior and user flow.
